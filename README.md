# INT2Group4

Neural network classifier project, using a dataset containing [pictures of flowers](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/), provided by the University of Oxford.

We are using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.Flowers102.html) to learn to classify flowers.
